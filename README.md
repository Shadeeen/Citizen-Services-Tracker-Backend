## 📌 Overview

**Citizen Services Tracker (CST)** is a backend-focused Management Information System (MIS) built to help municipalities efficiently manage citizen-reported service issues.

The system enforces **structured workflows**, **SLA policies**, and **performance tracking**, while providing **geo-based visualization** and **analytics dashboards** to support data-driven decision making.
